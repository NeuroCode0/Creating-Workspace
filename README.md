Creating Your Main Workspace

To start professionally, we must begin with the most important step:

    Building an organized and clear workspace that gathers all your work in one place.
    
Why do we need a workspace?

    Without structure and organization:
    •	Data is easily lost.
    •	Files and datasets will grow over time.
    •	Projects will accumulate, and without a system… you may lose track of your work or get overwhelmed.
    •	Having a clear structure from the beginning makes it easier to add new projects without creating chaos.
________________________________________
Step 1: Create the Main Workspace Folder
This is the main folder that contains all your work.
Example name:
Name_Company_Workspace
This main folder is the “home” for all future projects and tasks.
________________________________________
Step 2: Create a Folder for Each Project or Task
Within the main workspace, create a separate folder for every new project.
Example:
Restaurant_Analysis
This folder contains everything related to that project.
________________________________________
Step 3: Divide Each Project Into 3 Main Folders
Within each project folder, create the following three essential subfolders:
________________________________________
1️RawData
This folder stores all original data exactly as received without any modifications.
Why is this important?
•	Acts as a backup in case something goes wrong.
•	Keeps the original dataset safe.
•	Helps you compare data before and after processing.
________________________________________
2️ ProcessedData
This folder stores data after cleaning, fixing issues, or applying transformations.
•	You can save multiple versions (v1, v2, v3...) with dates or clear descriptions.
•	Helps track the project’s development step-by-step.
•	Makes it easy to return to any previous stage without confusion.
________________________________________
3️ Reports
This folder is for your final outputs:
•	Ready to deliver reports
•	Final datasets after analysis
•	Tables, results, and the final presentation
This is the folder you hand off to clients or management.
________________________________________
Notes File -> Notes.txt
After creating the project folders, add one more important file:
notes.txt
Why is this file important?
•	Documents all steps you took during the project.
•	Helps anyone who works after you understand the workflow.
•	Keeps track of changes, ideas, and updates.
•	Very helpful for follow-up, verification, and maintaining project clarity.

What’s next?
Now you have a solid foundation for a professional workspace.
The next step is to start adding your first project and follow this structure every time
This will keep your work organized, clean, and easy to manage over time.
